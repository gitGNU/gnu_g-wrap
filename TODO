** Simple Tasks

* Tests for generic functions creation

* Make WCT types extensible via subclassing

* Validate WCT arguments (and return values?) against the (null-ok)
  typespec option

* Properly class WCTs

** More involved tasks

* Write a compitibility layer offering the 1.3.4+ API

* Do the metaclass simplification of types vs. values

* Split into low-level and "approved" API
