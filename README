G-Wrap -- A tool for exporting C libraries into Scheme interpreters
===================================================================

G-Wrap is a tool (and guile library) for generating function wrappers
for inter-language calls. It currently only supports generating Guile
wrappers for C functions. Other languages may be supported in the
future, possibly on both sides.

Installing
==========

Run ./configure and then "make" and "make install".
Note:
+ Use option --prefix={where} to tell ./configure where
  to install g-wrap.

Notes about this branch
=======================

This is G-Wrap-TNG (G-Wrap - The Next Generation), a rewrite of
G-Wrap. It's goals are:

* Use GOOPS, for enhanced flexibility and (hoepfully) clearer design.

* Be target-language agnostic; i.e. clean separation of the core and
  e.g. the Guile-specific code. New languages (perhaps even
  non-Schemes) should be easy to add.

* Offer the current (1.3.4+) wrapping API as a compatibility layer.

Status
------

Currently, the features from 1.3.4 are present and superceded. It
should be considered "ready for testing". However, the docs have not
been fully updated yet.  They will be, but it may take a bit of time.

You can see the current docs, such as they are, in doc/g-wrap.texi and
the resulting info pages.  They have been partially updated, but still
need a *lot* of work.

Some kind of a compatibilty layer still needs to be written.
