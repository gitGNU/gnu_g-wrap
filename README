Notes about this branch
=======================

This is G-Wrap-TNG (G-Wrap - The Next Generation), an experimental 
rewrite of G-Wrap. It's goals are:

* Use GOOPS, for enhanced flexibility and (hoepfully) clearer design.

* Be target-language agnostic; i.e. clean separation of the core and
  e.g. the Guile-specific code. New languages (perhaps even
  non-Schemes) should be easy to add.

* Offer the current (1.3.4+) wrapping API as a compatibility layer.

Status
------

Currently, the features from 1.3.4 are mostly present, 
but there are still issues to come up regarding weapset 
dependencies in combination with non-RTI types.
